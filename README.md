- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jacks-lab
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things computers, although i enjoy hardware projects over software. Don't get me wrong software is still great :)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning network science by building an apache raspberry pi home server. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Snow skiing and mountain biking are among my other hobbies.
